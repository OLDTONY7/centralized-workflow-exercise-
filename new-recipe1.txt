# Coke Chicken Wings Recipe
## I. Ingredients Preparation
1. 500 grams of chicken wing mid - sections (about 8 - 10 pieces)
2. 1 can of Coke (330 ml or 500 ml)
3. 1 piece of ginger
4. 1 section of scallion
5. 2 star anises
6. 1 small piece of cinnamon bark
7. 2 tablespoons of cooking wine
8. 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce
9. 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce
10. 1 teaspoon of salt
11. Appropriate amount of cooking oil

## II. Cooking Steps
1. **Processing the Chicken Wings**: Wash the chicken wings thoroughly and pat dry the surface with kitchen paper towels to prevent oil splashing during frying. Make several cuts on both sides of each chicken wing to facilitate flavor penetration. This step is like opening "small windows" on the chicken wings, allowing seasonings to seep in better.
2. **Blanching to Remove Odor**: Add an appropriate amount of water to the pot, put in ginger slices, scallions, and 1 tablespoon of cooking wine. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then add the chicken wings. Blanch for about 2 - 3 minutes until blood foam appears on the surface. Remove the chicken wings with a slotted spoon and rinse them with clean water to remove the residue on the surface. Blanching helps to remove the fishy smell and impurities from the chicken wings, laying a good foundation for the subsequent cooking.
3. **Frying the Chicken Wings**: Heat an appropriate amount of cooking oil in a pan over medium - high heat. When the oil is hot, gently place the chicken wings in the pan. Fry until the surface turns golden brown, then turn them over and fry the other side until golden. This step gives the chicken wings a crispy and delicious outer layer.
4. **Seasoning and Stewing**: Push the fried chicken wings to one side of the pan, add the star anises and cinnamon bark to the oil on the other side and stir - fry for a while to release their fragrance. Then add 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and stir - fry evenly so that the chicken wings are evenly coated with the sauce. Next, pour in the Coke. The amount of Coke should be just enough to cover the chicken wings. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 20 - 25 minutes. During the simmering process, turn the chicken wings occasionally to ensure they are evenly cooked. The slow simmering in Coke allows the chicken wings to fully absorb the sweet and mellow flavor of Coke.
5. **Adjusting the Thickness of the Sauce and Seasoning**: After simmering for the specified time, turn up the heat to boil the sauce. Add 1 teaspoon of salt according to your taste to adjust the flavor. Keep stirring until the sauce thickens. The thickened sauce will coat the chicken wings, making them more flavorful and shiny.
6. **Plating**: Finally, transfer the Coke chicken wings to a plate, pour the thickened sauce on top, and you can sprinkle some chopped scallions on the surface for decoration. Now, the delicious Coke chicken wings are ready to be served.
